    "# Synthetic Dataset Creation for Mid Semester Project\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we create the synthetic datasets which students will use for their mid-semester project.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goals of the Dataset**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Require multiple table joins across multiple dimenstions\n",
    "* Rows are timestamped, students will need to do out of time joins to create training data\n",
    "\n",
    "## Description of the Problem (What students will see)\n",
    "\n",
    "You work in the data science department at _Dr. D's Direct-Sales Paperclip Company_.\n",
    "Dr. D believes in selling paperclips the old fashioned way: over the phone.\n",
    "In the paperclip business, knowing your customer is key.\n",
    "Matching each customer with the correct salesperson is very important to ensure a successful sale.\n",
    "However, historically Dr. D has simply let the process be completely random.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recently, Dr. D decided to try to use machine learning to improve the company.\n",
    "Using a historical dataset of sales data, he has assigned you and your team to create a model which will help assign salespeople to calls they should be making that day.\n",
    "Each day you get a list of potential customers, and a list of salespeople working that day and must match each sales person to make the call they are best at, in order to maximize revenue that day.\n",
    "Salespeople have six hours to make calls each day.\n",
    "Calls last between 1 and 60 minutes (selling paperclips is complicated work!)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Facts**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. There are a certain number of salespeople who work at Dr D's whose job it is to make sales calls.\n",
    "2. Sales people have enough time to make between 20 and 30 calls per day.\n",
    "3. Each day, there is a list of customers which we would like to call.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tables**\n",
    "\n",
    "You have access to a historical dataset which contains the following information\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The salesperson table, which gives information about the sales team members\n",
    "2. The customers table, which gives information about specific customers\n",
    "3. The calls table, which details specific sales calls which have taken place. Including who made the call, to whom, how long the call took, etc.\n",

    "## Generating the Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's the plan.\n",
    "\n",
    "We randomly generate about 20 salespeople and around 1000 companies.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Generating Customers\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal here is to create a collection of potential customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "For each customer, we generate a unit vector in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ (maybe 4 or 5?) which represents thier _true personality._\n",
    "This vector is hidden from the student.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Select $N$ customers, $N << 1000$ (around 30 or so). These are the prototype customers.\n",
    "2. For each prototype customer, we generate features randomly.\n",
    "3. For all other customers, we assign each customer to the prototype it is nearest to (via the personality vector).\n",
    "4. Generate all the features of the prototype customer with respect to distributions centered around the features of the prototype it was assigned to.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a sanity check, train a classification algorithm which predicts which prototype a given customer was assined to.\n",
    "If accuracy < 90 or > 98%, then retune the parameters of the above algorithm.\n",
    "We want the companies to be pretty similar to their prototype, but not _exactly_ the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, generate two more hidden parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Average Order Size\n",
    "* Refill time\n",
    "\n",
    "### Generating Salespeople\n",
    "\n",
    "Create around 20 salespeople, 25% \"junior\", 50% \"mid-level\" and 25% \"senior\"\n",
    "For each salesperson, create a list of vectors in $\\mathbb{R}^3$.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Junior -> 1-3 vectors\n",
    "* Mid-level -> 2-5 vectors\n",
    "* Senior -> 4-7 vectors\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, we generate to more random parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "* _charisma_ between 0.0 0.1.\n",
    "* _efficiency_ between 15 and 45.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Determining a Sale\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose salesperson $S$ calls customer $C$. \n",
    "Let $\\vec{c}$ be $C$'s personality vector, $\\{\\vec{s}_i\\}$ be $S$'s set of vectors, and $c_S$ be $S$'s charisma.\n",
    "We can calculate the probability of a successful sale by taking the dot product of $\\vec{c}$ with each of $S$'s vectors and taking the max.\n",
    "If this is < 0, set the probability to zero.\n",
    "Lastly, add $S$'s charisma, but to not let $P$ exceed .9.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Code which does the above\n",
    "\n",
    "def sale_proba(customer_vec: np.ndarray, sales_vecs: List[np.ndarray], charisma: float):\n",
    "    ps = [customer_vec @ s for s in sales_vecs]\n",
    "    max_p = max(ps + [0])\n",
    "    final_p = min(max_p + charisma, .95)\n",
    "\n",
    "    return final_p\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Generating Historical Calls\n",
    "\n",
    "Historically, Dr. D. has just assigned customers to salespeople totally randomly.\n",
    "\n",
    "* For each date, we first determine which salespeople were working at Dr. D's that day.\n",
    "* Shuffle the list of customers, removing all customers which had a sale < 5 days ago.\n",
    "* For each salesperson:\n",
    "  - Generate a call time using a distribution centered at _efficieny_\n",
    "  - If the generated time > remaining time, end this salesperson\n",
    "  - Pull the next customer off the sorted list\n",
    "  - Determine the probability of sale\n",
    "  - If a sale occurs, then generate a sale (explained below)\n",
    "  - Subtract the call time from the remaining time for making calls\n",
    "  - Repeat\n",
    "\n",
    "### Generating Sales\n",
    "\n",
    "When generating a sale, assign the sale date to the date of the call that generated the sale.\n",
    "Companies will not make a purchase if there has not been enough time. If time since last sale < refill time, ommit this sale.\n",
    "Sale ammount is sampled from a log-normal distribution, centered at average order size."
